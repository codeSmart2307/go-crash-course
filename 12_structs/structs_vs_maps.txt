Maps
====

All keys must be of the same type
All values must be of the same type
Keys are indexed - we can iterate over them
Used to represent a collection of related properties
Don't need to know all the keys at compile time
Maps are a reference type


Structs
========

Values can be of different types
Keys don't support indexing
You need to know all the different fields at compile time
Used to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
Structs are a value type
