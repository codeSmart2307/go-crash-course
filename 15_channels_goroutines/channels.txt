* Channels are used to communicate between running goroutines
* Channels are the only way to maintain communication between goroutines and acts as an intermediary between all the
  goroutines in a program
* Channels are statically typed
    - If we make a channel of type string, we can only use that channel for communication with strings

Syntax
======

* c := make(chan string)
    - Declaring a channel of type string
* channel <- "hello"
    - Send the value "hello" into the channel
* myVariable <- channel
    - Wait for a value to be sent to the channel and once the value is received, assign it to myVariable
* fmt.Println(<-channel)
    - Wait for a value to be sent to the channel and once the value is received, log it out immediately
